## Overview

### Requirements 

Users should be able to:

    ✅ View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
    ✅ See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
    ✅ Create, read, update, and delete product feedback requests
    ✅ Receive form validations when trying to create/edit feedback requests
    ✅ Sort suggestions by most/least upvotes and most/least comments
    ✅ Filter suggestions by category
    ✅ Add comments and replies to a product feedback request
    ✅ Upvote product feedback requests
    ❌ **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This was a fun project to build, and the whole process was a huge learning experience, from managing state, conditional rendering, passing props, routing, working with arrays, and more.

- **Note: Some of the problems in this challenge are brute force solutions and I am awere that I could have avoided some prop drilling issues with context.**

### Useful resources

- [SPA with GH-Pages](https://github.com/rafgraph/spa-github-pages) - This was a handy resource when deploying a SPA to GH-Pages since it does not support React SPA's natively. Huge props to the author; this repository helped me figure out many of my questions during the deployment process.
